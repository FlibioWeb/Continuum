Continuum is a continuous integration artifact storage system built using PHP. Continuum does not do any project testing, but instead stores build artifacts. This is perfect for CI systems such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) that only test projects and do not store the artifacts. Continuum can run on nearly any webserver that can run PHP code, making it accessible to all users.
